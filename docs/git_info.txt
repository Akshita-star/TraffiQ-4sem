SMART TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
TEAM GIT WORKFLOW GUIDE

---

1. GIT BASIC IDEA

---

Git is used to:

* Track code history
* Work in a team safely
* Merge features into final project

Main branch = final stable code
Branches = individual work areas

---

#####FIRST STEP – CLONE REPOSITORY

---

Command:

git clone <repo-link>
cd <repo-folder>

Example:

git clone [https://github.com/Akshita-star/TraffiQ-4sem.git]
cd TraffiQ-4sem

---

3. SWITCH TO YOUR ASSIGNED BRANCH

---

Each member must work only on their branch. And should only merge the branch with main when it is finalized and it is working.

Command:

git checkout branch-name

Example:

git checkout simulation-module

---

4. AFTER MAKING CHANGES – SAVE & PUSH

---

Step-by-step commands:

git status
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your change clearly"
git push

Meaning:
add → select files
commit → save locally
push → upload to GitHub

IMPORTANT:
**Without push, team cannot see your work.**

---

5. PULL LATEST CODE BEFORE STARTING WORK

---

git pull

Always pull before new work to avoid conflicts.

---

6. DO NOT WORK ON MAIN BRANCH

---

Main branch is only for final merged code.
All development must happen in module branches.

---

7. BRANCH NAMES FOR PROJECT

---

simulation-module
backend-module
database-analytics-module
frontend-module

Each member must use only their assigned branch.

---

9. GOLDEN RULES

---

• Always pull before starting work
• Always commit with clear message
• Always push after completing task
• Never delete someone else’s code
• Never work directly on main
